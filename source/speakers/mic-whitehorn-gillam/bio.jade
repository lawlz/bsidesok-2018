| I started coding in the late 80s with MS-DOS batch files and later BASIC. a few years later I moved into Windows GUI apps, and then started into websites around 1997. It was several years later that I actually became primarily a web app developer, where I had full-stack responsibilities for the vast majority of a decade across several different stacks. Security was always an area of interest for me. I learned as much as I could, applied it as a developer, and in the last year it became my primary responsibility as a penetration tester. I don't know everything about web apps, but I've picked up a lot over the years and I'm always grateful for the opportunity to share that knowledge.
