| How one line of Python can bring your network to its knees - and how to prevent it.
| In this talk, we’ll cover how to create a script that will cause Denial of Service throughout the network by creating IP address conflicts. After demonstrating the effects, we’ll discuss how to prevent this from happening in your network. Internal networking weaknesses are well known, and strategies to mitigate the problems have been around for a long time.  What is new today is the ease with which attackers can cause massive chaos inside your network, and how many IoT devices are probably running free throughout your environment. Fortunately for the Blue Team, the Python language, and specifically the Scapy library, make it incredibly easy to craft and send fake packets, so mocking up attacks in the lab is easier than ever. Covered topics include how ARP works, an quick intro to Python and SCAPY, a script to cause chaos, and some tips on configuring your network to fight back.
