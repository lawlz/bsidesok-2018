| Sounds of a Scammer
| This presentation will include actual audio recordings of telephone calls and voicemails from scammers, collected by the FBI. The main feature will be a series of telephone calls a fraudster makes to a bank, pretending to be a bank customer. There will also be several voicemails left for money mules which had been hired by overseas front companies in order to facilitate the movement of electronically stolen funds to points overseas. If there is time, I will give a brief cyber crime presentation, and discuss topics of interest to the audience.
