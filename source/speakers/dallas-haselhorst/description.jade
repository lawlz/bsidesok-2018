| Uncovering IoC using PowerShell, Event Logs, and Nagios
| What security concerns keep you up at night? Is it pivoting, persistent access, the time to detect compromise, or one of a thousand other possibilities? What if you were told that without a doubt, you have tools at your disposal to periodically verify your security posture and you are not presently using them? Why spend more hours and more budget implementing a new product with new agents and new headaches that will not effectively reduce your workload or anxiety level? Even if you have commercial tools already monitoring your systems for security events, how do you know they are working? Is it even practical to use a customized PowerShell scripts/plugins, built-in event logs, and a traditional monitoring tool such as Nagios to monitor for indicators of compromise on Windows systems? In addition, you will be presented with some applied research as well as easy-to-follow guidelines you can integrate into your own environment(s).
