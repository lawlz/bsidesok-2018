| Making the web accessible to people with disabilities is fundamental to the web itself. An accessible web extends opportunities for learning, teaching, working and participating to a larger audience that traditionally faces barriers to access at every turn.
| You may be good with accessibility already. Some headings here, some alt attributes there. A good start. But how does that work on accessibility actually change things for people with disabilities? Part of the answer lies in testing sites and applications to identify barriers to access.
| Developing accessible applications is a lot easier if you can work some testing into your development workflow without adding loads of time or money to the process. This session will teach you how you can use a few tools and techniques to diagnose lots of barriers to access that your users with disabilities encounter. As you learn about some of the tools, you will also learn more about what makes the web more accessible.
