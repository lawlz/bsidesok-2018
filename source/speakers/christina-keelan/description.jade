p Building collaborative, realtime apps is a challenge. It's an even bigger challenge when you're new to programming. I wanted to learn to code... but was I biting off more than I could chew? Enter Horizon, an open-source, realtime backend that dramatically simplifies the process of building modern JavaScript apps. As someone with little programming experience who’s just learning to code, I could use Horizon to build real apps!

p In this talk, we’ll build Mixtape — an app for sharing playlists. It has all the components of modern applications — frontend, backend, dealing with APIs, etc. Using Horizon's client API, we'll be taking full advantage of Angular2's first-class support for observables. Keeping your views synchronized with the server in realtime has never been easier! We'll tie it all together with the Spotify API, allowing users to browse tracks and import playlists. The icing on the cake -- cheese on the pizza? -- I've got a fun UI for the user to personalize their "mixtape" and share. By the end of the conference, I hope everyone is sending mixtapes to all their friends :D
